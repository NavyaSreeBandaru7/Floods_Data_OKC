## 📈 Key Research Findings

### **🌡️ Climate Change Validation**
- Empirical confirmation of 64-68% higher flood risks for tribal communities
- Increasing trend in high-severity events since 2019
- Spring-summer seasonal concentration (65% of events)

### **🗺️ Geographic Patterns**
- Arkansas River corridor shows highest vulnerability
- Urban counties (Oklahoma, Tulsa) demonstrate flash flood dominance
- Rural counties show agricultural impact concentration

### **📊 Statistical Significance**
- Mann-Kendall trend analysis reveals increasing damage trends
- Weibull distribution analysis provides robust return period estimates
- 95% confidence intervals support policy-relevant conclusions

## 🔬 Research Methodology

### **Statistical Methods**
- **Mann-Kendall Trend Test**: Non-parametric trend detection (α = 0.05)
- **Weibull Distribution**: Flood frequency and return period analysis
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Trend, seasonal, and residual component separation
- **Correlation Analysis**: Multi-variable relationship assessment

### **Severity Classification**
Quantitative thresholds based on economic and human impact:
- **High**: >$10M damage OR >10 casualties OR ≥2 fatalities
- **Medium**: $1-10M damage OR 1-10 casualties OR 1-2 fatalities
- **Low**: <$1M damage AND <1 casualty
